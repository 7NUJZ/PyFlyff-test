# Features

There is a Mini FTool within the client. You can configure it to spam heals with your RM, and the keys are send even if the Main Window is on the Background, making it a 100% AFKable hotkey spammer. Try to not abuse it much, you might get banned. It is there more to aliviate key spam during gameplay.

The key to stop the Mini FTool is "End" on your Keyboard.

Also, this only works on Windows, since I'm using Win32 APIs.

You can control the Alt Client by sending a hotkey command from the Main Client, meaning that you can command your FS/RM to heal you without having to alt-tab and pressing the hotkey where the healing skill is. This will make it easier to also play with your FS/RM while also playing with your main character and encourage less afkable bot heal spam with the Mini Ftool.

Keep in mind that I'll never implement a full bot like feature into my client, and if you get caught by some GM where him/her sees you acting like a botter using automated behavior to heal you, you will probably get banned. This "Alt Control" feature I implemented should be more than enough to play with your FS/RM to heal you without losing focus from your main character and without getting banned since it not automated, you are still pressing keys.
